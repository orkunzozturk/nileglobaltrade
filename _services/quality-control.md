        Many communication problems can be eliminated by offering product samples to your customers. Instead of having to deal with shipping samples to each customer, we keep a sample stock for you in our China warehouse and send it to potential customers as needed.

        We package your samples in a professional, aesthetically pleasant way to leave the best first impression on your customers.

        Due to China's distance from the Middle East and Africa, product returns pose a large amount of risk for sellers. By identifying customer requirements and assisting you with manufacturing accordingly, we help you eliminate product returns, and any disputes that may arise due to quality issues.

        We also provide you with handling all the relevant paperwork and agreements with your customers, while offering legal and business advice in order to help you get the most feasible conditions for your business.

Our  eye for quality and transparency has earned us the continued trust of our buyer network in China. By working with Nile Global Trade, that trust it automatically lent to you.
