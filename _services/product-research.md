        It's tempting to look at China as an homogenous market. However in reality, China is made up of different regions with vastly different industries and consumption. Industrial centers of the North and Coastal China offer vast opportunities for Middle Eastern and African mining companies. Agricultural products find success in the temperate regions of the South.

        For each one of our customers, we conduct bespoke market research reports, highlighting the best region and the kind of customer for your products. We then help you prepare your products, packaging and pricing for China market entry. Some of our customers were able to increase their product pricing by up to 45% by making simple adjustments to their products.

        China has its own quality certification body called CCC. Given the process of certifying foreign products can take up to 9 months, many exporters are reluctant to enter the Chinese market on their own. This gives way to middlemen in OBOR countries who simply get certifications and earn <strong>profits that you could be earning.</strong>

        We help you simplify the process of certification by providing you with all the paperwork and testing required to sell your products in China. Thus far, we helped manufacturers get:  <br>

        China's state-owned companies are unparalleled compared to other nations. Although the process of joining their supplier list is full of bureucratic red tape, the steady demand they generate can mean constant sales for your business.
      - |-
        On the other hand, private companies are much faster to respond to your offers, and are more pragmatic in their dealings with Middle Eastern and African suppliers.

        Nile Global Trade has built a vast network of both state-owned and private companies in China across the years. Our personal connections and familiarity with these companies mean that we can help you start doing business with them in the shortest time possible.
